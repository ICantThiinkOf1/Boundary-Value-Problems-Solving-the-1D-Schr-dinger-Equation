# Boundary-Value-Problems-Solving-the-1D-Schr-dinger-Equation
This project explores the application of boundary value problem techniques to solve the one-dimensional, time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation. It includes Python implementations for defining constants, potential functions, and numerical methods to compute the wavefunction and energy eigenvalues for a given potential.
